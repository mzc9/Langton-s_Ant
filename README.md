# Langton's_Ant

The goal of this project is to simulate Langton's Ant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant), a cellular automaton that follows two simple rules with each step in a matrix of cells.  

The project was created during course work in C++ and designed to run in a Linux terminal.
