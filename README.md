# Langton's_Ant

The goal of this project is to simulate Langton's Ant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant), a cellular automaton that follows two simple rules with each step in a matrix of cells.  

The project was created during course work in C++ and designed to run in a Linux terminal.

Specifications of the project are given in the specs.txt file.

Design decisions are in the design document which includes the test plan and the test results.  Changes made to the program as a result of the test plan are also included in this document.

To run the program, ensure that all files from the code folder are downloaded in the same location. Run the make command in the terminal.
