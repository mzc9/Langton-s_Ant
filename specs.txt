The goal of this assignment is to simulate Langton’s ant, a cellular automaton that follows 
two simple rules with each step in a matrix of cells.  

These rules that the Ant follows as it traverses the grid are:

◦ If the Ant lands on a white square, Ant turns 90 0  to the right and on leaving that cell, 
changes the cell to black
◦ If the Ant lands on a black square, Ant turns 90 0  to the left and on leaving that cell, 
changes the cell to white

In order for the simulation to run, inputs from the user include:

◦ number of rows and columns for the board used in the simulation
◦ number of steps that the Ant traverses the grid, with suggestions 
  to the user that higher number of steps would be optimal to get the 
  true impact of the simulation
◦ the starting location of the Ant
